# Garden-of-Eden
I hope to live in a Garden of eden, where many fruit trees grow and you can pick the fruit up and eat them. In the future,if possible I'd like to work to set them up. But there are basic ground for it. To block the snakes.

I DESIRED MERCY and not sacrifice. And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. There have they dealed treachrouly against me. (Hosea 6:4 )
AND THEY HAVE NOT CRIED UNTO ME with their heart, when they howled upon their bed. They assemble themselves for corn and wine
and they revel against me. (Hosea 6:14)
